  "description": "The goal of the Blood Bank Management System is to organize donor information, blood inventory, and hospital requests in order to track donations, assign blood products as they become available, and generate reports in a timely manner. The database is described using an Entity- Relationship (ER) diagram which defines the entities of the system (i.e. Donor, Hospital, Blood_Inventory, Recipient_Request) and their relationships and constraints. To facilitate avoidance of redundancy in the database, normalization is performed to the Third Normal Form (3NF). In the First Normal Form (1NF), all attributes are atomic, in the Second Normal Form (2NF), partial dependencies are resolved, and in the Third Normal Form (3NF), transitive dependencies are avoided, preserving the integrity of the data across all the tables. The Blood Bank Management System is developed with Flask for the backend, PostgreSQL for the database, and a responsive frontend with Tailwind CSS and Next.js. The major features of the Blood Bank Management System are donor management, real-time blood inventory, automated data validation using constraints and triggers, coordination between multiple hospitals, and managing the system with complete Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionality. Utilizing all of these features can improve efficiency, reduce manual entry errors, and help manage blood donations and requests on an integrated, centralized, and scalable platform.",
